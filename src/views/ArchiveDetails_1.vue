The installation is consisted an on-site web station that allows audience to navigate through our search engine, a collection of promotional commercial videos, an encounter with 50 Cents Party, who is a group of notorious mainland web commentator renowned for providing online click rate service, interactive split flip counters that connect to the keyword database on the engine, an art archive kit that explores the boundary of professional/institutional and amateur archiving in art.</em></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><em >Art Archive Kit</em></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span >-</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span >​is for everyone involved in creative process of art-making, including audience, teachers, students, administrative personnel, artists, curators, scholars, etc. The kit introduces how art projects can be organized, archived and eventually being utilized or open for public access.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span >​</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span > </span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span >Aim of the kit</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span >- </span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span >To demystify archive;</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span >To give a very comprehensive introduction;</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span >To introduce straightforward archiving procedures;</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span >To relate to our research about Archives.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><em >Dancing with 50 Cents Party</em></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span >Single-channel video | color | 8’15” | 16:9 | &nbsp;English and Korean subtitle</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span >​</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span >A Guide to Archive Me originates from the concern about how artists being archived in both internet and physical repository, in that aims at unearthing the scattered or hidden information about art. &nbsp;Being part of this project, Art(ist) Searching Engine -  </span><a href="http://www.archiveme.art/" target="_blank" >www.archiveme.art</a><span > - &nbsp;is built as a platform to connect artists electronically. &nbsp;In order to review internet and search engine as a record system, the platform engages artists in contributing metadata. &nbsp;However, in 50 Cent Party engagement, it is justified that the correlation does not always imply causation. In general, search engine scans content all over World Wide Web and systematically selects the most relevant to certain topics and keywords, this is regarded as algorithm. &nbsp;Akin to archivist to history, algorithm varies on every single search engine, which determines materials that are visible to internet users. In order to reach potential users and deliver the content efficiently, Archive of the People (AOP) expands artists’ online visibility through www.archiveme.art; Art(ist) Searching Engine is otherwise in need to gain a ground in the ocean of internet. Preliminary AOP hired the infamous 50 cent Party to boost our popularity and visibility among conventional search engines. </span></p><p><span >50 cent Party is a colloquial term describing a group or freelance internet commentators. &nbsp;The major reason of engaging 50 Cent Party in this project because its affiliation with Chinese authority on manipulating public opinion and internet surveillance; on the other hand, the party provides services to generate textual content that specifically designed to satisfy search engine algorithm. The major differences between Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and 50 Cent Party are the quality of content, and how the content is linked to the website in favour of the algorithm. When the negotiation with multiple 50 Cent Parties continues, we are told that </span><a href="http://www.archiveme.art/" target="_blank" >www.archiveme.art</a><span > is inaccessible, very likely to be blocked by the Great Firewall of China. &nbsp;One 50 Cent Party points out that the first page of the search engine is a blank page. &nbsp;In such case, they can provide very limited service in contributing contents.  AOP could have looked for other service providers outside China, but we find the engagement very symbolic. &nbsp;As an upshot of building a rhizomatic network for artists, </span><a href="http://www.archiveme.art/" target="_blank" >www.archiveme.art</a><span > reaches out to various internet users and does not limit to any regions; unfortunately, the search engine is wiped out and becomes invisible.</span></p><p><span >**</span></p><p><span >For reference: </span><a href="http://www.leekaichung.com/a-guide-to-archive-me-2018" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">http://www.leekaichung.com/a-guide-to-archive-me-2018</a></p>
